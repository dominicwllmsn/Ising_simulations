Vortices are shown as blue circles and antivortices as red circles. They are able to move through the lattice and upon meeting a vortex-antivortex pair will annihilate - this is analogous to the Coulomb interaction between electric point charges.

The result of a L = 4 cubic lattice at T = 0.1 J/kB after 20 sweeps of the Metropolis algorithm. Once the system equilibrated, Ei, Mi, Ï‡ and C were measured.
